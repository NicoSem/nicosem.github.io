        description: 'A self developed algorithm to plot a polynomial function to a set of points. My Python project utilizes advanced algorithms to perform polynomial curve fitting on input data points. With a PySide-driven GUI, it seamlessly integrates NumPy and Matplotlib for efficient numerical computations and dynamic visualization. This showcases my technical skills in data analysis, algorithmic implementation, and graphical interface development.',
